# Data Science Internship OIBSIP
## Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship Project

Welcome to the repository for my Data Science Internship Project with Oasis Infobyte. This project is a result of my efforts in completing three tasks assigned during the internship, aimed at solving real-world problems through data science methodologies.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 2: Unemployment analysis with python
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total lanour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during covid-19,so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.

#### Data set:

### Task 4: Email spam detection with machine learning 
we've all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail,or junk mail,is a type of mail that is sent to a massive number of users at one time,frequently containing cryptic messages scams or most dangerously content.
in this project use Python to built an email spam dector.Then use machine learning to train the spam detector to reconize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.

### Task 5: Sales prediction using python 
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segement of people you advertise for, or the platform you advertising on about product.

Tipically, a product and service-based business always need their data scientist to pedict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product.
